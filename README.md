# Ring-a-Date Widget

A digital recreation of the classic Ring-a-Date perpetual calendar as an iPhone widget.

## Overview

This project aims to recreate the look, feel, and functionality of the Ring-a-Date perpetual calendar as an iOS widget. The original calendar uses three movable rings to mark the current day, date, and month, and this digital version will maintain that interactive experience while adding modern customization options.

## Features

- Three movable digital rings to mark day, date, and month
- Manual date updating to preserve the interactive experience of the original
- Customizable background colors
- Customizable ring colors
- Multiple widget sizes

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a SwiftUI-based iOS widget extension
2. Design the calendar face with all days, dates, and months
3. Implement draggable rings that snap to appropriate positions
4. Create a configuration interface for customization options
5. Implement widget timeline provider for updates

## Design Reference
