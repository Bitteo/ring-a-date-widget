# Ring a Date

A digital recreation of the classic "Ring a Date" perpetual calendar as an iOS
home screen widget, with a minimal companion app to customize its colors.

## What it does

- **Widget** (small, medium and large): draws the perpetual calendar board —
  a row of weekdays, dates 1–31 on four rows of eight columns, and months on
  two rows — with rings marking today's weekday, date and month. The date
  advances by itself at midnight.
  - *Large*: the full board, faithful to the original layout and spacing.
  - *Medium*: weekday and month pegs beside the full date grid.
  - *Small*: weekday, date and month pegs stacked, so they stay legible.
- **App**: a single screen with a live preview of the widget in all three
  sizes, six color presets (Classico, Avorio, Notte, Terracotta, Oceano,
  Ardesia) and a custom editor for every color: background, pegs, text and
  the three rings (day, date, month). Changes reach the widget immediately.

## Project structure

```
xcode-ring-a-date/
├── Shared/                      Compiled into both the app and the widget
│   ├── CalendarTheme.swift      Theme model, presets, App Group storage
│   └── RingADateFace.swift      The calendar face (full/split/compact layouts)
├── xcode-ring-a-date/           App target
│   ├── xcode_ring_a_dateApp.swift
│   ├── ThemeStore.swift         Observable theme + widget reload
│   ├── ContentView.swift        Preview, presets, color editor

└── RingADateWidget/             Widget extension target
    ├── RingADateWidget.swift    Bundle, timeline provider, entry view

    └── RingADateWidget.entitlements
```

The app and the widget share the theme through the App Group
`group.jigo.xcode-ring-a-date` (see `ThemeStorage` in
`Shared/CalendarTheme.swift`). If the group container is unavailable the code
falls back to standard user defaults, so the app runs even before the
capability is provisioned — but the widget will only pick up custom colors
once the App Group is active on **both** targets.

## Setup

1. Open `xcode-ring-a-date.xcodeproj` in Xcode 16 or later.
2. Select your development team on the `xcode-ring-a-date` and
   `RingADateWidgetExtension` targets (Signing & Capabilities).
3. Make sure the App Group `group.jigo.xcode-ring-a-date` is registered for
   your team. If you need a different identifier, change it in the two
   `.entitlements` files and in `ThemeStorage.appGroupID`.
4. Run the app once, then add the widget from the Home Screen
   (long-press → Edit → Add Widget → Ring a Date).

## Design reference

Based on the classic Ring-a-Date perpetual calendar: a square board of pegs
with three movable rings for the current weekday, date and month.
